              This is the broken branch of a small tree near the railway. It was located on way back home from school. It has taken by useing auto pro-mode in phone camera to reduce bright sunlight, and 3 by 3 guidelines on the screen to centralize the element. Also, the focus on the element included the texture and reality feelings of the tree branch in the photograph.

              This is a photograph of the scenery of a maple tree in Victoria Park; which is located near the house. Because it’s located in a nearby residential area, there are many other objects that are non-natural elements. However, the centralized tree still shows great depth of nature and its majesty in the photograph. Additionally, the colours and sunlight on the top of the tree give the viewer a warm and mysterious feeling.

            The studio had only one window on the door and it was curved with paper. Also, we used a big fabric on the floor to cover the light from the aperture of the door. Therefore, when we turned the light off in the room, it was pitch black.
            <p>
              The camera was set on a tripod which was about 4 yards away from one and one was standing about 2 feet away from the wall. One's teammate set manual mode on the camera and manually focused the camera on one. Moreover, the shutter speed and aperture of the camera was set to 30 seconds and f-5.

            <p>
              When we got everything ready, one turned the coloured flashlight on, covered it with my hand. One got into my first position(the left eye), and we turned off the light in the room. One's other teammate pressed the shutter release, and at the same time, one uncovered one's hand from the flashlight.

            This is the result of the light writing plan. One used orange light and drew the left eye first. One covered the light when one moved to another spot for writing. However, as one moved from the left eye to the right eye, one's hand was not fast enough to cover the light, and therefore, it remained a short line on the left eye. After drawing the right eye, one moved to the mouth. It was hard to conjecture the start and the end of the mouth, so it’s been moved a bit on the result. Also, as one moved on to draw a tongue, one missed drawing the position of it.

              Thus, the result of the light writing was a bit disappointing, however, our team was in a rush to finish the light writing, so one couldn’t have a second shot. Though it was an interesting experience.
